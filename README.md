## Hello!! ðŸ‘‹

I graduated recently (woo!), so I have time to get back into coding outside of my degree again!

Mostly just figuring out stuff at the moment. Not sure what will come next... But this feels like an important first step.

I'm currently focusing on improving my Python, and also on learning SQL. Plus whatever else looks interesting / turns out to be useful. Maybe I'll even make something someday that other people will be able to use!
